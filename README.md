The main purpose of this project is to walk through the full pipeline of data science using real-world, high-impact data. To do this, we chose to focus on earthquakes, a natural phenomenon that continues to have devastating effects across the globe. Earthquakes are unpredictable, destructive, and can drastically alter both natural landscapes and human societies in a matter of seconds. By using recent and historical seismic data, we aim to understand earthquake behavior more clearly and explore whether data science techniques can help uncover meaningful insights.

We are using a dataset provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which offers detailed records on recent global earthquakes. These records include attributes such as the earthquake's magnitude, depth, location, time, and type. With this dataset, we seek to the key question:

Can we use features like location and depth to predict earthquake strength or classify seismic events?
